## Historical Background

### The Birth of a Tradition

The Open Championship was first played on October 17, 1860, at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland. Originally designed to crown the champion golfer following the demise of famed golfer Allan Robertson, the tournament featured a modest field of eight professionals contending over three rounds on a 12-hole course. It was in 1860 that Willie Park Sr. emerged as the inaugural champion, a milestone that set the stage for centuries of competitive spirit and sporting excellence.

As the tournament grew in prominence, key landmarks emerged, such as the introduction of the Claret Jug in 1872. This trophy, which replaced the original Challenge Belt, has since become emblematic of golfing success and is deeply interwoven with the tournament’s lore. The early decades of The Open witnessed Scottish dominance, led by figures like Young Tom Morris, whose consecutive victories contributed to the tournament’s emerging mythos.

### Expansion and Global Influence

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the tournament’s reach began to expand beyond Scotland, embracing venues across the United Kingdom. Iconic courses such as Royal St George’s, Royal Liverpool, and Carnoustie entered the rotation, each offering distinctive challenges reflective of their local landscapes and coastal influences. Notably, international competition began to gain ground with players like Arnaud Massy, the first non-British winner, who broke new ground in 1907.

The historical panorama of The Open has also been shaped by key eras—the Great Triumvirate of Vardon, Taylor, and Braid during the late 1800s and early 1900s; the American breakthroughs of Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones; and the post-war legends such as Tom Watson and Seve Ballesteros, all of which have enriched the tournament’s narrative.

## Tournament Format and Rules

### Competition Structure

The format of The Open Championship has largely remained a 72-hole stroke play competition played over four days, from Thursday to Sunday. In typical fashion, the field is composed of 156 top golfers from around the world. During the initial two rounds, players usually tee off in groups of three—strategically scheduled across both morning and afternoon sessions—to navigate the challenging links courses.

After the first 36 holes, a cut is implemented where only the top 70 players (including ties) progress to the final rounds. This mechanism ensures that the tournament remains both competitive and manageable in terms of player numbers.

### Playoff Procedures

In the event of a tie at 72 holes, The Open adopts a unique playoff format. Traditionally, a four-hole aggregate playoff is employed to determine a winner across a predetermined set of holes. Should the tie persist even after this, the competition escalates to a sudden-death playoff on the iconic 18th hole – a nerve-wracking climax that has produced some of the most dramatic moments in the tournament’s history.

### The Influence of Nature

Unlike many tournaments held on manicured courses, The Open is always played on links courses. These courses are characterized by undulating terrain, deep pot bunkers, thick gorse, and significant exposure to weather elements such as wind and rain. The constant battle against the elements adds an unpredictable variable that challenges players to adapt their strategy depending on the day’s conditions—a central theme that has defined many of The Open’s most memorable contests.

## Iconic Moments and Champions

Over its long history, The Open Championship has been home to countless unforgettable moments. The tournament has been witness to dramatic victories and astonishing collapses, serving as a stage upon which legends are both made and tested.

### Legendary Duels

One of the most storied chapters in Open history is the 1977 “Duel in the Sun” at Turnberry, where Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus engaged in a riveting contest. Watson’s victory by a single stroke remains emblematic of the fierce competitive spirit that defines The Open. Equally memorable was the 1999 Open at Carnoustie, where Jean van de Velde’s collapse on the 18th hole turned what seemed like a comfortable lead into an agonizing defeat, culminating in a playoff won by Paul Lawrie.

### Modern Marvels

In recent years, champions such as Xander Schauffele, Brian Harman, and Cameron Smith have carried the torch, each adding a distinctive chapter to the tournament’s ongoing narrative. Schauffele’s triumph at the 2024 Open Championship at Royal Troon—with a remarkable final-round 65—cemented his status as one of golf’s elite performers during a period when American golfers showcased dominance across major tournaments.
