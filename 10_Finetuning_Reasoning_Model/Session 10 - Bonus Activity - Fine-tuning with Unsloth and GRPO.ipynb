    "# Reward-Tuned, Reality-Checked: Lessons from GRPO Fine-Tuning\n",
    "## 🔧 Step 1 – Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is optimized for Google Colab and aims to support **GRPO fine-tuning** with **LLaMA 3.1 8B** using **Unsloth** and **vLLM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key setup notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Enables 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency (via `bitsandbytes`)\n",
    "- ✅ Installs `Unsloth`, `trl`, and `peft` to support GRPO-style fine-tuning\n",
    "- ✅ Uses `vLLM` for efficient inference and execution (patched for compatibility)\n",
    "- ✅ Pulls in `datasets`, `sentencepiece`, and `huggingface_hub` to support tokenizer and dataset access\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup ensures:\n",
    "- 🔋 Lower memory usage (thanks to quantization)\n",
    "- ⚙️ Compatibility with GRPO training patterns\n",
    "- 📚 Access to the Open R1 Math dataset via the Hugging Face Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Dependencies are installed in a Colab-safe way and include patches to resolve known incompatibilities between `vLLM`, `transformers`, and `xformers`.\n",
    "\n",

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, since p is a prime number, possible values for p are 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. Maybe I should start by testing small primes like 2 and 3 first because they\\'re simpler and might give me some pattern or rule.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with p=2. Then the expression becomes x² + y² + z² - x - y - z. I need this to be a product of three distinct primes. Let me try small values for x, y, z. Since they are positive integers, the smallest values are 1, 1, 1.\\n\\nPlugging in x=1, y=1, z=1: 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 0. That\\'s not helpful. So maybe 1,1,2?\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=2: 1 + 1 + 4 -1 -1 -2 = 2. 2 is a prime, but we need a product of three distinct primes. So that\\'s not it.\\n\\nHow about x=2, y=2, z=2: 4 + 4 + 4 - 2 - 2 -2 = 6. 6 factors into 2*3, which is two primes. Not enough.\\n\\nMaybe try different combinations. Let\\'s see x=2, y=1, z=1: 4 + 1 +1 -2 -1 -1 = 2. Still prime.\\n\\nx=3, y=1, z=1: 9 +1 +1 -3 -1 -1=6. Again 2*3. Hmm.\\n\\nWhat if x=2, y=2, z=3: 4 +4 +9 -2 -2 -3=10. 10=2*5. Still two primes.\\n\\nWait, maybe larger numbers. Let\\'s try x=3, y=2, z=2: 9 +4 +4 -3 -2 -2=10. Same as above.\\n\\nx=3, y=3, z=3: 9 +9 +9 -3 -3 -3=18. 18=2*3*3. Three primes but two are the same. So not distinct.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe x=4, y=1, z=1: 16 +1 +1 -4 -1 -1=12. 12=2*2*3. Again duplicates.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=4: 4 +9 +16 -2 -3 -4=20. 20=2*2*5. Nope.\\n\\nWait, maybe higher numbers. Let\\'s try x=5, y=2, z=1: 25 +4 +1 -5 -2 -1=22. 22=2*11. Two primes.\\n\\nx=4, y=3, z=2: 16 +9 +4 -4 -3 -2=20. Still 20. Hmm.\\n\\nThis is getting tedious. Maybe there\\'s a pattern here. For p=2, the expression is x² + y² + z² -x -y -z. Let\\'s see if we can represent this in another way. Maybe complete the square for each variable.\\n\\nFor each variable, say x² -x. Completing the square: x² -x = x² -x + 1/4 -1/4 = (x - 1/2)² -1/4. But since x is an integer, (x - 1/2)² is a square of a half-integer. Not sure if that helps.\\n\\nAlternatively, note that x² -x = x(x -1). Similarly for y and z. So the entire expression is x(x -1) + y(y -1) + z(z -1). So x(x -1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it\\'s always even. Similarly for y and z. Therefore, the entire expression is even + even + even = even. So the result is even, meaning it\\'s divisible by 2. So the product of three distinct primes must include 2. Therefore, the expression is 2 times two other distinct primes. So the total would be 2*q*r where q and r are distinct primes different from 2.\\n\\nSo maybe we can set x(x -1) + y(y -1) + z(z -1) = 2*q*r.\\n\\nBut how do we find x, y, z such that this is true? Let\\'s note that x(x -1) is 0 when x=1, 2 when x=2, 6 when x=3, 12 when x=4, etc.\\n\\nSo the possible contributions from each variable:\\n\\nIf x=1: 0\\n\\nx=2: 2\\n\\nx=3: 6\\n\\nx=4: 12\\n\\nx=5: 20\\n\\nx=6: 30\\n\\nSimilarly for y and z.\\n\\nSo let\\'s consider possible combinations of x, y, z where the sum of their x(x-1) terms equals a number which is 2*q*r. Let\\'s see.\\n\\nLet me try x=2, y=2, z=3: 2 + 2 + 6 = 10. 10=2*5. But we need three primes. Wait, 10 is 2*5, which is two primes. Not enough.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=3: 2 +6 +6=14. 14=2*7. Again two primes.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=4: 2 +6 +12=20. 20=2*2*5. Three primes but duplicates.\\n\\nx=3, y=3, z=3: 6 +6 +6=18. 18=2*3*3. Again duplicates.\\n\\nx=3, y=3, z=4: 6 +6 +12=24. 24=2*2*2*3. Too many duplicates.\\n\\nx=2, y=4, z=5: 2 +12 +20=34. 34=2*17. Two primes.\\n\\nx=3, y=4, z=5: 6 +12 +20=38. 38=2*19. Two primes.\\n\\nx=4, y=4, z=4: 12 +12 +12=36. 36=2*2*3*3. Nope.\\n\\nWait, perhaps if one of the variables is 1. Let\\'s try x=1, y=2, z=3: 0 +2 +6=8. 8=2*2*2. All duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=3, z=4: 0 +6 +12=18. 18=2*3*3. Again duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=4, z=5: 0 +12 +20=32. 32=2^5. Not enough.\\n\\nx=1, y=5, z=6: 0 +20 +30=50. 50=2*5*5. Still duplicates.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe we need one term to be larger. Let\\'s see x=5: 20, so x=5, y=2, z=2: 20 +2 +2=24. Same as before.\\n\\nx=5, y=3, z=2: 20 +6 +2=28. 28=2*2*7. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=5, y=5, z=5: 20 +20 +20=60. 60=2*2*3*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=6, y=2, z=3: 30 +2 +6=38=2*19. Two primes.\\n\\nx=6, y=6, z=6: 30 +30 +30=90=2*3*3*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nWait, maybe if two variables are 1? Let\\'s try x=1, y=1, z=4: 0 +0 +12=12=2*2*3. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=5: 0 +0 +20=20=2*2*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=6: 0 +0 +30=30=2*3*5. Wait, 30 is 2*3*5. That\\'s three distinct primes! So x=1, y=1, z=6: the expression is 30, which is the product of three distinct primes. So that works for p=2.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s verify that. If p=2, x=1, y=1, z=6:\\n\\nx² + y² + z² -x - y - z = 1 + 1 + 36 -1 -1 -6 = 30. 30=2*3*5. Exactly three distinct primes. So p=2 is possible.\\n\\nIs this the only case? Let\\'s check other possibilities where two variables are 1. Let\\'s try x=1, y=1, z=7: 0 +0 +42=42=2*3*7. Also three distinct primes. So 42. So that would also work. Wait, but z=7: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -x -y -z = 1 +1 +49 -1 -1 -7=42. 42=2*3*7. So that\\'s another example. So there are multiple solutions for p=2. So p=2 is possible.\\n\\nWait, but the problem says \"Find all prime numbers p\". So if p=2 works, maybe other primes work as well. Let me check p=3.\\n\\nFor p=3, the expression is x³ + y³ + z³ -x - y - z. Again, we need this to be a product of exactly three distinct primes. Let\\'s try small values.\\n\\nStarting with x=1, y=1, z=1: 1 +1 +1 -1 -1 -1=0. Not helpful.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=2: 1 +1 +8 -1 -1 -2=6. 6=2*3. Two primes.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=3: 1 +1 +27 -1 -1 -3=24. 24=2*2*2*3. Too many duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=4: 1 +1 +64 -1 -1 -4=60. 60=2*2*3*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=5: 1 +1 +125 -1 -1 -5=120. 120=2*2*2*3*5. Nope.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=2: 1 +8 +8 -1 -2 -2=12. 12=2*2*3. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=2: 8 +8 +8 -2 -2 -2=18. 18=2*3*3. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=3: 1 +8 +27 -1 -2 -3=30. 30=2*3*5. Three distinct primes! So here, x=1, y=2, z=3 for p=3 gives 30, which is 2*3*5. So p=3 is also possible.\\n\\nWait, let me check: 1³ + 2³ + 3³ -1 -2 -3 = 1 +8 +27 -1 -2 -3 = 36 -6 = 30. Yes, correct.\\n\\nSo p=3 also works. Interesting. So both p=2 and p=3 are possible. Let\\'s check p=5.\\n\\nFor p=5, the expression is x⁵ + y⁵ + z⁵ -x - y - z. Let\\'s try small numbers.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=1: 1 +1 +1 -1 -1 -1=0. No good.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=2: 1 +1 +32 -1 -1 -2=30. 30=2*3*5. Three distinct primes. Wait, so x=1, y=1, z=2: 1⁵ +1⁵ +2⁵ -1 -1 -2=1 +1 +32 -1 -1 -2=30. So that\\'s 2*3*5. Exactly three distinct primes. So p=5 also works.\\n\\nWait, so p=5 also works. Hmm. Maybe p=7?\\n\\nLet me check p=7. x=1, y=1, z=2: 1 +1 +128 -1 -1 -2=126. 126=2*3*3*7. Duplicates. Not good.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=3: 1 +1 +2187 -1 -1 -3=2183. Hmm, 2183 is a prime? Wait, 2187 is 3^7, so 2187 -3=2184. Wait, wait, x=1, y=1, z=3: 1^7 +1^7 +3^7 -1 -1 -3=1 +1 +2187 -1 -1 -3=2187 -3=2184. 2184 divided by 2 is 1092. Divided by 2 again is 546. Divided by 2 again is 273. 273=3*91=3*7*13. So 2184=2^3*3*7*13. That\\'s four prime factors, with duplicates. So not three distinct.\\n\\nWhat if x=1, y=2, z=2: 1 +128 +128 -1 -2 -2=252. 252=2^2*3^2*7. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=3: 1 +128 +2187 -1 -2 -3=2187 +128 -6=2309. Is 2309 a prime? Let me check. 2309 divided by primes: 2309 ÷2=1154.5. Not integer. ÷3: 2309/3≈769.666. ÷5: no. ÷7: 2309/7≈329.857. Not integer. ÷11: 2309/11≈209.909. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it\\'s prime. If so, then 2309 is a prime, so the expression would be a single prime, which is not a product of three. But actually, wait: x=1, y=2, z=3 for p=7: 1 + 128 + 2187 -1 -2 -3= (1 -1) + (128 -2) + (2187 -3)=0 + 126 + 2184=2310. Wait, I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me recheck.\\n\\nWait: 1^7 is 1, 2^7 is 128, 3^7 is 2187. So sum is 1 +128 +2187=2316. Then subtract x + y + z =1 +2 +3=6. So 2316 -6=2310. 2310. 2310 is a well-known number; it\\'s 2*3*5*7*11. So that\\'s five distinct primes. So 2310 is a product of five distinct primes. Therefore, that\\'s more than three, so it doesn\\'t fit.\\n\\nBut maybe if we take smaller z? Let\\'s try x=1, y=1, z=2: 1 +1 +128 -1 -1 -2=126. Which is 2*3^2*7. Still duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=4: 1 +1 +16384 -1 -1 -4=16384 -4=16380. 16380 factors into 2^2*3^2*5*7*13. Too many primes.\\n\\nHow about x=2, y=2, z=2: 128 +128 +128 -2 -2 -2= 384 -6=378. 378=2*3^3*7. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=3, z=3: 1 + 2187 +2187 -1 -3 -3=4374 -7=4367. Not sure what that factors into. Let\\'s see: 4367 ÷ 13=335.923. Not integer. ÷7=623.857. Not. ÷11=396.09. No. Maybe prime? If so, then it\\'s a single prime, not a product.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look for other combinations. For p=7, is there any x, y, z such that x^7 + y^7 + z^7 -x -y -z is a product of three distinct primes?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe try x=1, y=1, z=1: 0, as before. x=1, y=1, z=2: 126, which is 2*3^2*7. Not good.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=2: 1 +128 +128 -1 -2 -2=252=2^2*3^2*7. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=4: 1 +128 +16384 -1 -2 -4=16384 +128 -6=16506. 16506 divided by 2=8253. 8253 divided by 3=2751. Divided by 3 again=917. 917 ÷7=131, which is prime. So 16506=2*3^2*7*131. Four distinct primes, but with duplicates. Not good.\\n\\nHmm, maybe p=7 doesn\\'t work. What about p=5? Wait, earlier with p=5, x=1, y=1, z=2 gives 30=2*3*5. So that works. What about p=5 with other numbers?\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=3: 1 +1 +243 -1 -1 -3=240. 240=2^4*3*5. Too many factors.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=2: 1 +32 +32 -1 -2 -2=60. 60=2^2*3*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=2:32 +32 +32 -2 -2 -2=96 -6=90. 90=2*3^2*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=3:1 +32 +243 -1 -2 -3=243 +32 -6=269. 269 is a prime. So that\\'s a single prime, not a product.\\n\\nWait, so p=5 can only give us three distinct primes in some specific cases. We already saw that x=1, y=1, z=2 gives 30=2*3*5. Let me see if there are other combinations for p=5.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=4:1 +1 +1024 -1 -1 -4=1020. 1020=2^2*3*5*17. Four primes with duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=4:1 +32 +1024 -1 -2 -4=1050. 1050=2*3*5^2*7. Four primes with duplicates.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=3:32 +32 +243 -2 -2 -3=243 +64 -7=300. 300=2^2*3*5^2. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=3, z=3:1 +243 +243 -1 -3 -3=486 -7=479. 479 is a prime.\\n\\nSo seems like for p=5, the only way to get a product of three distinct primes is when x=1, y=1, z=2, giving 30. Or maybe other combinations?\\n\\nWait, x=1, y=1, z=2 is unique? Let\\'s check x=2, y=1, z=1: same as above, 30. Similarly permutated variables. So the only case for p=5 is when two variables are 1 and the third is 2. So gives 30.\\n\\nSo p=5 works. What about p=7? Doesn\\'t seem to get a case with exactly three primes. Maybe higher primes?\\n\\nWait, let\\'s check p=7 again. Suppose we take x=1, y=1, z=2: as before, 126=2*3^2*7. Which is three primes but with duplicates. Not allowed. If we take x=1, y=1, z=3: 1 +1 +2187 -1 -1 -3=2183. Is 2183 a prime?\\n\\n2183 ÷13=167.923, not integer. Let\\'s check 2183 ÷7=311.857, not. ÷3=727.666, nope. Let\\'s check if 2183 is prime. Let me see. 2183. The square root is around 46.7. So check primes up to 47.\\n\\n2183 ÷5=436.6, not. ÷7=311.857, ÷11=198.454, ÷13=167.923, ÷17=128.411, ÷19=114.894, ÷23=94.913, ÷29=75.275, ÷31=70.419, ÷37=59.0, ÷37=59.0 (exact?), 37*59=2183? 37*50=1850, 37*9=333, total 1850+333=2183. Yes! So 2183=37*59. Both primes. So 2183=37*59. So that\\'s two primes. So 2183 is a product of two primes, so not three. So that doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=1, y=2, z=4:1 +128 +16384 -1 -2 -4=16384 +128 -6=16506. As before, which factors into 2*3^2*7*131. Four distinct primes but with duplicates.\\n\\nSo maybe p=7 doesn\\'t work. Let\\'s check p=7 with x=1, y=3, z=3:1 +2187 +2187 -1 -3 -3=4371. 4371. Let\\'s factor this. ÷3: 1457. 1457 ÷13=112.07. ÷7=208.14. ÷11=132.45. Not obvious. Maybe 1457 ÷17=85.7. Maybe prime? If 1457 is prime, then 4371=3*1457. But 1457 ÷31=47.0. 31*47=1457? 31*40=1240, 31*7=217, total 1240+217=1457. Yes! So 1457=31*47. Thus, 4371=3*31*47. Three distinct primes! So 3*31*47. So that\\'s three distinct primes. So p=7, x=1, y=3, z=3 gives 4371=3*31*47. So three distinct primes. Therefore, p=7 also works.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s verify that. x=1, y=3, z=3. For p=7:\\n\\n1^7 +3^7 +3^7 -1 -3 -3 =1 +2187 +2187 -1 -3 -3= (1 -1) + (2187 +2187) - (3 +3)=0 +4374 -6=4368. Wait, wait, that conflicts with earlier calculation. Wait, 1 + 2187 +2187 = 4375. Then subtract 1 +3 +3=7. So 4375 -7=4368. Wait, so 4368. Let me factor 4368.\\n\\nDivide by 2: 2184. Again by 2: 1092. Again by 2: 546. Again by 2: 273. 273=3*91=3*7*13. So 4368=2^4*3*7*13. That\\'s four distinct primes with exponents. So that\\'s 2,3,7,13. So more than three. So my mistake earlier was miscalculating the total.\\n\\nWait, maybe I did the arithmetic wrong. Let\\'s compute again: 1^7=1, 3^7=2187. So 1 +2187 +2187=4375. Then subtract x+y+z=1+3+3=7. So 4375 -7=4368. 4368 factors into 2^4 *3 *7 *13. So four distinct primes. Therefore, not three. So my initial thought was wrong. So that doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nHmm. So maybe p=7 doesn\\'t have a solution. Let me try another combination. x=1, y=2, z=5:1 +128 + 78125 -1 -2 -5=78125 +128 -8=78245. 78245. Let\\'s divide by 5: 78245 ÷5=15649. Check if 15649 is prime. Let\\'s see, sqrt(15649)≈125.1. Check primes up to 127. ÷7=2235.571, ÷11=1422.636, ÷13=1203.769, ÷17=920.529, ÷19=823.63, ÷23=680.391, ÷29=539.62, ÷31=504.8, ÷37=422.946, etc. Not obvious. Maybe it\\'s prime. If so, 78245=5*15649. If 15649 is prime, then product of two primes. Not three. So that\\'s not helpful.\\n\\nHow about x=2, y=2, z=3:128 +128 +2187 -2 -2 -3=2187 +256 -7=2436. 2436 divided by 2=1218, ÷2=609, ÷3=203, ÷7=29. So 2436=2^2*3*7*29. Four distinct primes. Not good.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=3:128 +2187 +2187 -2 -3 -3=2187*2 +128 -8=4374 +120=4494. 4494 ÷2=2247. ÷3=749. Check if 749 is prime: ÷7=107. So 749=7*107. Thus, 4494=2*3*7*107. Four distinct primes. So again, more than three.\\n\\nHmm. So maybe p=7 doesn\\'t have a solution. Let\\'s check p=5 again. Wait, we had x=1, y=1, z=2 gives 30=2*3*5. What if x=1, y=1, z=3:1 +1 +243 -1 -1 -3=240=2^4*3*5. So duplicates. Not acceptable. So p=5 seems to only have that one case.\\n\\nSimilarly, for p=3, we had x=1, y=2, z=3 gives 30. Are there other cases for p=3?\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=2:1 +1 +8 -1 -1 -2=6=2*3. Two primes.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=4:1 +1 +64 -1 -1 -4=60=2^2*3*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=1, y=3, z=3:1 +27 +27 -1 -3 -3=54 -7=47. Prime. Single prime.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=2:8 +8 +8 -2 -2 -2=18=2*3*3. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=3:8 +8 +27 -2 -2 -3=36=2^2*3^2. Duplicates.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=4:8 +27 +64 -2 -3 -4=94=2*47. Two primes.\\n\\nSo for p=3, only the case x=1, y=2, z=3 gives 30=2*3*5. So p=3 works.\\n\\nSo far, p=2,3,5 have solutions. Wait, what about p=7? Maybe there\\'s another combination. Let me think.\\n\\nAlternatively, try x=1, y=2, z=2:1 +128 +128 -1 -2 -2=252=2^2*3^2*7. Not good.\\n\\nx=1, y=4, z=4:1 +16384 +16384 -1 -4 -4=32768 -9=32759. Is 32759 a prime? Not sure. Probably difficult to factor, but even if it\\'s prime, that\\'s only one prime. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=3, y=3, z=3:2187*3 -9=6561 -9=6552. 6552=8*819=8*3*273=8*3*3*91=8*3*3*7*13. So 2^3*3^2*7*13. Four distinct primes with duplicates.\\n\\nSo maybe p=7 doesn\\'t work. Let\\'s check p=11. Maybe even higher primes, but likely numbers get too big. Let\\'s try p=11 with x=1, y=1, z=2:1 +1 +2048 -1 -1 -2=2046. 2046=2*3*11*31. Four distinct primes. So more than three. Not good.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=3:1 +1 +177147 -1 -1 -3=177143. Not sure, but likely a prime or a product of few primes. 177143 ÷3=59047.666, ÷7=25306.142, ÷11=16103.909. Maybe prime. If so, product of one prime. Not helpful.\\n\\nSo seems like higher primes either give numbers with more than three prime factors or duplicates.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s check p=7 with x=2, y=2, z=2:128*3 -6=384-6=378=2*3^3*7. Duplicates.\\n\\nAlternatively, p=7 and x=1, y=2, z=7:1 +128 +823543 -1 -2 -7=823543 +128 -10=823661. That\\'s a huge number. Probably not factoring into three primes.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe some other combination? It\\'s getting too time-consuming. Let\\'s recap:\\n\\nFor p=2: possible, example x=1, y=1, z=6 gives 30=2*3*5.\\n\\nFor p=3: possible, example x=1, y=2, z=3 gives 30=2*3*5.\\n\\nFor p=5: possible, example x=1, y=1, z=2 gives 30=2*3*5.\\n\\nFor p=7: Tried several combinations, but couldn\\'t find any that result in exactly three distinct primes. Seems like p=7 doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nWait, but for p=5, if we take x=1, y=1, z=2, we get 30=2*3*5. Similarly for p=2 and p=3. So maybe all primes p can do this by taking x=1, y=1, z=2 or something similar. Wait, let\\'s check for p=7: x=1, y=1, z=2 gives 1 +1 +128 -1 -1 -2=126=2*3^2*7. That\\'s three primes but with duplicates. So not acceptable.\\n\\nBut for other primes, like p=7, if we take x=1, y=1, z=k, what do we get? 1 +1 +k^7 -1 -1 -k =k^7 -k. So k^7 -k. We need k^7 -k to be a product of three distinct primes.\\n\\nk=2:128 -2=126=2*3^2*7.\\n\\nk=3:2187 -3=2184=2^3*3*7*13.\\n\\nk=4:16384 -4=16380=2^2*3^2*5*7*13.\\n\\nSo seems like as k increases, the number of prime factors increases. So likely, for p≥2, if we take x=1, y=1, z=k, then the expression is k^p -k. So we can factor this as k(k^{p-1} -1). For k=2: 2(2^{p-1} -1). For this to be a product of three distinct primes, 2 must be one prime, and (2^{p-1} -1) must be a product of two distinct primes.\\n\\nSo for example, when p=2: 2^{1} -1=1. So 2*1=2. Not three primes.\\n\\nWait, but earlier we saw for p=2, taking x=1, y=1, z=6 gives 6² -6=30=2*3*5. So in that case, z=6: 6² -6=30. So 6*5=30. So factorization is 6*5=2*3*5.\\n\\nSo generalizing, if we take x=1, y=1, z=k, then the expression is k^p -k. For this to be a product of three distinct primes, k^p -k must equal q*r*s where q, r, s are distinct primes.\\n\\nAlternatively, if k is composite, k^p -k may factor into more components. For example, k=6, p=2: 6^2 -6=30=2*3*5. So three primes. For k=6 and p=2: 6=2*3, so k^p -k=6*5=2*3*5. So this works.\\n\\nSimilarly, for other primes p, can we find k such that k^p -k is the product of three distinct primes?\\n\\nFor p=3: Let\\'s take k=2: 8 -2=6=2*3. Two primes.\\n\\nk=3:27 -3=24=2^3*3. Duplicates.\\n\\nk=4:64 -4=60=2^2*3*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nk=5:125 -5=120=2^3*3*5. Duplicates.\\n\\nk=6:216 -6=210=2*3*5*7. Four primes. Too many.\\n\\nk=7:343 -7=336=2^4*3*7. Duplicates.\\n\\nk=5: already checked.\\n\\nWait, but for p=3, we had a different solution: x=1, y=2, z=3. Let\\'s see what that gives:1 +8 +27 -1 -2 -3=30=2*3*5. So this is 30. But how does this relate to k? It\\'s not of the form k^p -k. Instead, it\\'s x^3 + y^3 + z^3 -x -y -z. So not the same as the previous case. So there might be multiple ways to achieve the product of three primes for different primes p.\\n\\nSimilarly, for p=5, we had x=1, y=1, z=2:1 +1 +32 -1 -1 -2=30=2*3*5.\\n\\nSo in this case, k=2: 2^5 -2=30. Which factors into 2*3*5. So here, k=2 for p=5 gives a product of three primes.\\n\\nSimilarly, if we can find for a prime p, a k such that k^p -k is a product of three distinct primes, then p is a possible solution.\\n\\nSo let\\'s formalize this. For prime p, if there exists a positive integer k such that k^p -k is a product of three distinct primes, then p is a solution. Additionally, there might be solutions where not all variables are 1 except one, but those might be harder to find.\\n\\nSo let\\'s analyze k^p -k.\\n\\nFactor k^p -k =k(k^{p-1} -1). For this to be a product of three distinct primes, k must be either:\\n\\n1) k is a prime, and (k^{p-1} -1) is a product of two distinct primes.\\n\\nOr\\n\\n2) k is a product of two primes, and (k^{p-1} -1) is a prime.\\n\\nBut since k is a positive integer greater than 1 (as k=1 gives 1 -1=0). Let\\'s check case 1: k is prime.\\n\\nCase 1: k is prime. Then k^p -k =k*(k^{p-1} -1). We need this to be a product of three distinct primes. So since k is prime, k^{p-1} -1 must be a product of two distinct primes. Note that k and the primes in k^{p-1} -1 must be distinct.\\n\\nFor example, take p=5, k=2:2^5 -2=30=2*3*5. Here, k=2, and k^{p-1}-1=2^{4} -1=16-1=15=3*5. So 3 and 5. So 2*15=2*3*5. So yes, three distinct primes. Similarly, for p=3 and k=2:2^3 -2=6=2*3. Only two primes. Doesn\\'t work, but earlier solution for p=3 was different.\\n\\nWait, but in p=3, the solution was not of the form k^p -k. So maybe the k^p -k approach is only one way, but other combinations can also give solutions. However, for primes p=2,3,5, we can find solutions either through k^p -k or other variable combinations. But for higher primes, like p=7, even the k^p -k approach doesn\\'t yield a product of three primes.\\n\\nLet me check for p=7, k=2:2^7 -2=128 -2=126=2*3^2*7. Three primes but with duplicates. So not allowed.\\n\\nk=3:3^7 -3=2187 -3=2184=2^3*3*7*13. Four primes.\\n\\nk=5:5^7 -5=78125 -5=78120=2^3*3*5*7*11*17. Way too many primes.\\n\\nk=7:7^7 -7=823543 -7=823536=2^4*3^3*7^4. Lots of duplicates.\\n\\nk=4:4^7 -4=16384 -4=16380=2^2*3^2*5*7*13. Five primes.\\n\\nk=6:6^7 -6=279936 -6=279930=2*3*5*7*31*43. Six primes.\\n\\nSo even for p=7, k from 2 to 7 don\\'t give products of three distinct primes. So perhaps p=7 is not possible. Similarly, higher primes would lead to even larger numbers with more prime factors.\\n\\nTherefore, the possible primes p are 2,3,5. Let me confirm for p=5:\\n\\nWe saw that k=2 gives 30=2*3*5, which works. Also, maybe other k for p=5? For example, k=3:3^5 -3=243 -3=240=2^4*3*5. Duplicates. k=4:4^5 -4=1024 -4=1020=2^2*3*5*17. Four primes. So only k=2 works for p=5.\\n\\nSimilarly, for p=3, k=2 gives 6=2*3. Only two primes, but we had another solution with x=1, y=2, z=3, which gives 30. So even if k^p -k doesn\\'t work, other combinations might. But in this case, even for p=3, we needed a different combination.\\n\\nSimilarly, for p=2, the solution came from k=6:6² -6=30. So 6 is not prime. But 6=2*3, so k=6, a composite, gives k^2 -k=30. Let\\'s analyze this case.\\n\\nFor composite k, k=ab, then k^p -k=ab(ab)^{p-1} -ab=ab[(ab)^{p-1} -1]. For example, k=6=2*3, p=2:6² -6=30=2*3*5. Here, 6=2*3, and [(6)^{1} -1]=5. So 6*5=2*3*5. So in this case, for composite k=6 and p=2, we get three distinct primes.\\n\\nSimilarly, maybe other composite k and primes p.\\n\\nSo perhaps the possible primes p are those where there exists either a prime k or composite k such that k^p -k factors into three distinct primes.\\n\\nFor p=2, k=6 gives 30=2*3*5.\\n\\nFor p=3, x=1, y=2, z=3 gives 30=2*3*5.\\n\\nFor p=5, k=2 gives 30=2*3*5.\\n\\nInterestingly, all three cases result in 30. Maybe 30 is the magic number here.\\n\\nIs there another number which is the product of three distinct primes that can be formed for other primes p?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe all primes p can form 30 in some way.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s check:\\n\\nFor p=2: x=1, y=1, z=6:1 +1 +36 -1 -1 -6=30.\\n\\nFor p=3: x=1, y=2, z=3:1 +8 +27 -1 -2 -3=30.\\n\\nFor p=5: x=1, y=1, z=2:1 +1 +32 -1 -1 -2=30.\\n\\nSo for p=2,3,5, we can get 30, which is 2*3*5. For p=7, can we get 30? Let\\'s try:\\n\\nx^7 + y^7 + z^7 -x -y -z=30.\\n\\nBut 30 +x + y + z =x^7 + y^7 + z^7. Let\\'s see if there are small x,y,z such that x^7 + y^7 + z^7=30 +x + y + z.\\n\\nThe smallest possible values:\\n\\nx=1:1 + y^7 + z^7=30 +1 + y + z → y^7 + z^7=29 + y + z.\\n\\nTry y=1:1 + z^7=29 +1 + z →z^7 -z=28.\\n\\nz^7 -z=28. For z=2:128 -2=126≠28. z=1:0. z=3:2187 -3=2184≠28. So no solution.\\n\\ny=2:128 + z^7=29 +2 + z →z^7= -97 +z. Not possible since z≥1.\\n\\nSo no solutions for p=7. Hence, p=7 cannot give 30, and other numbers also don\\'t seem to work.\\n\\nTherefore, the only primes p for which there exist x,y,z such that x^p + y^p + z^p -x -y -z is a product of three distinct primes are p=2,3,5.\\n\\nTo confirm that there are no others, we need to ensure that for p≥7, no possible x,y,z can make the expression a product of three distinct primes. Given that for p=7, attempts to find such x,y,z have failed and numbers tend to get too large with multiple prime factors, it\\'s reasonable to conjecture that p=2,3,5 are the only solutions.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe primes are \\\\boxed{2}, \\\\boxed{3}, and \\\\boxed{5}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo find all prime numbers \\\\( p \\\\) for which there exist positive integers \\\\( x, y, \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) such that the expression \\\\( x^p + y^p + z^p - x - y - z \\\\) is a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers, we analyze different values of \\\\( p \\\\).\\n\\n1. **Case \\\\( p = 2 \\\\)**:\\n   - The expression becomes \\\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x - y - z \\\\).\\n   - For \\\\( x = 1 \\\\), \\\\( y = 1 \\\\), \\\\( z = 6 \\\\), we get:\\n     \\\\[\\n     1^2 + 1^2 + 6^2 - 1 - 1 - 6 = 1 + 1 + 36 - 1 - 1 - 6 = 30\\n     \\\\]\\n   - \\\\( 30 = 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\), which is a product of three distinct primes.

Thus, \\\\( p = 3 \\\\) works.\\n\\n3. **Case \\\\( p = 5 \\\\)**:\\n   - The expression becomes \\\\( x^5 + y^5 + z^5 - x - y - z \\\\).\\n   - For \\\\( x = 1 \\\\), \\\\( y = 1 \\\\), \\\\( z = 2 \\\\), we get:\\n     \\\\[\\n     1^5 + 1^5 + 2^5 - 1 - 1 - 2 = 1 + 1 + 32 - 1 - 1 - 2 = 30\\n     \\\\]\\n   - \\\\( 30 = 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\), which is a product of three distinct primes. Thus, \\\\( p = 5 \\\\) works.\\n\\n4. **Case \\\\( p \\\\geq 7 \\\\)**:\\n   - Testing various combinations of \\\\( x, y, z \\\\) for primes \\\\( p = 7 \\\\) and higher results in numbers with more than three prime factors or duplicates. For example, \\\\( p = 7 \\\\) with \\\\( x = 1 \\\\), \\\\( y = 1 \\\\), \\\\( z = 2 \\\\) gives \\\\( 126 = 2 \\\\times 3^2 \\\\times 7 \\\\), which has duplicate primes. No valid combinations were found for higher primes.\\n\\nThus, the primes \\\\( p \\\\) for which the expression can be a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers are \\\\( \\\\boxed{2} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\boxed{3} \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\boxed{5} \\\\).', '<think>\\nOkay, so I need to find all prime numbers p such that there exist positive integers x, y, z where the expression x^p + y^p + z^p - x - y - z is a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers. Hmm, let\\'s break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, since p is a prime number, possible values are 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. The problem is asking for primes p where such x, y, z exist. So maybe I can check for small primes first and see if there\\'s a pattern or a possible restriction.\\n\\nLet me start with p=2. Then the expression becomes x² + y² + z² - x - y - z. I need to find x, y, z positive integers such that this expression is the product of three distinct primes. Let\\'s see if this is possible.\\n\\nMaybe try small values for x, y, z. Let\\'s take x, y, z as 1, 1, 1. Then the expression would be 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 0. That\\'s not helpful. How about x=2, y=2, z=2? Then it\\'s 4 + 4 + 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 12 - 6 = 6. 6 factors into 2*3, which is two primes, not three. So that\\'s not enough.\\n\\nWhat if we mix the numbers? Let\\'s try x=2, y=3, z=4. Then compute 4 + 9 + 16 - 2 - 3 - 4 = 29 - 9 = 20. 20 is 2²*5, which is not three distinct primes. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, maybe x=1, y=2, z=3. Then 1 + 4 + 9 - 1 - 2 - 3 = 14 - 6 = 8. 8 is 2³, not three primes. Not good.\\n\\nHow about x=3, y=3, z=3? 9 + 9 + 9 - 3 - 3 - 3 = 27 - 9 = 18. 18 is 2*3², again only two distinct primes.\\n\\nWait, maybe we need different values where the result is a product of three distinct primes. Let\\'s think. Let me try x=2, y=3, z=5. Then 4 + 9 + 25 - 2 - 3 - 5 = 38 - 10 = 28. 28 is 2²*7. Not three distinct primes.\\n\\nWait, maybe x=1, y=1, z=2. Then 1 + 1 + 4 - 1 - 1 - 2 = 6 - 4 = 2. 2 is a prime, but we need three distinct primes multiplied. Not enough.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe larger numbers. Let\\'s try x=3, y=4, z=5. Then 9 + 16 + 25 - 3 - 4 - 5 = 50 - 12 = 38. 38 is 2*19. Still two primes.\\n\\nWhat if x=4, y=5, z=6. Then 16 + 25 + 36 - 4 - 5 - 6 = 77 - 15 = 62. 62 is 2*31. Again two primes.\\n\\nWait, maybe if the result is 30. 30 is 2*3*5, three distinct primes. Let\\'s see if we can get 30. So, x² + y² + z² - x - y - z = 30. Let\\'s solve this equation.\\n\\nSo x² - x + y² - y + z² - z = 30. Each term x² - x is equal to x(x - 1). Since x is a positive integer, x(x - 1) is at least 0. For x=1, x² -x = 0. For x=2, it\\'s 2. x=3, 6. x=4, 12. x=5, 20. x=6, 30. Hmm, so maybe if x, y, z are small, their contributions could add up to 30.\\n\\nLet me try combinations. Let\\'s see if x=3, y=3, z=4. Then x² -x = 6, y² - y=6, z² - z=12. Total 6+6+12=24. Not enough.\\n\\nx=4, y=4, z=4: 12+12+12=36. That\\'s over 30. Maybe x=4, y=3, z=3: 12+6+6=24. Still no. x=5, y=2, z=2: 20 + 2 + 2=24. Hmm.\\n\\nHow about x=5, y=3, z=2: 20 + 6 + 2=28. Still 2 short. Then x=5, y=4, z=2: 20 + 12 + 2=34. Too much.\\n\\nWait, perhaps x=4, y=5, z=3: 12 + 20 + 6=38. No. Maybe x=3, y=4, z=5: 6 + 12 + 20=38. Still 38. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe x=6, y=2, z=2: 30 + 2 + 2=34. Still over. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, maybe x=2, y=5, z=5: 2 + 20 + 20=42. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the individual terms can be different. For example, x=4 (12), y=3 (6), z=5 (20). Sum 12+6+20=38. Not 30.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=5 (20), y=2 (2), z=3 (6). 20+2+6=28. Close. Maybe x=5, y=3, z=3: 20 + 6 + 6=32. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, is there a combination where x² -x + y² - y + z² - z =30? Maybe x=5, y=2, z=2: 20 + 2 + 2=24. x=5, y=3, z=1: 20 +6 +0=26. x=5, y=4, z=1:20 +12 +0=32. x=5, y=5, z=1:20 +20 +0=40. x=4, y=4, z=3:12+12+6=30. Wait, x=4, y=4, z=3. Then x=4, y=4, z=3. Let\\'s check: 4² +4² +3² -4 -4 -3 = 16+16+9 -11= 41 -11=30. Yes! So 30 is 2*3*5, three distinct primes. So for p=2, there exists x=4, y=4, z=3 such that the expression is 30, which is a product of three distinct primes. Therefore, p=2 is a possible candidate.\\n\\nOkay, so p=2 works. Now check if there are other primes. Let\\'s try p=3. The expression becomes x³ + y³ + z³ - x - y - z. We need this to be a product of three distinct primes.\\n\\nAgain, maybe try small x, y, z. Let\\'s start with x=1, y=1, z=1: 1 +1 +1 -1 -1 -1=0. Not good. x=2, y=2, z=2: 8 +8 +8 -2 -2 -2=24 -6=18=2*3². Not three distinct primes.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=2: 1 +1 +8 -1 -1 -2=6. 6=2*3. Two primes.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=3: 1 +8 +27 -1 -2 -3=36 -6=30=2*3*5. Hey, 30 is three distinct primes. Wait, so if x=1, y=2, z=3 with p=3, the expression is 1³ +2³ +3³ -1 -2 -3=1 +8 +27 -6=30=2*3*5. So that\\'s a product of exactly three distinct primes. Therefore, p=3 is also possible.\\n\\nWait, so p=3 works. Let me verify that again. 1³ +2³ +3³ =1 +8 +27=36. Subtract x+y+z=1+2+3=6. 36-6=30. Yep, that\\'s correct. 30 factors into 2*3*5. So p=3 works.\\n\\nNow, check p=5. Let\\'s see. The expression is x⁵ + y⁵ + z⁵ -x -y -z. Need this to be a product of three distinct primes. Let\\'s try small x, y, z. Let\\'s try x=1, y=1, z=1: 1+1+1 -1-1-1=0. Not good. x=1, y=1, z=2:1 +1 +32 -1 -1 -2=32 -4=28=2²*7. Not three primes.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=2:1 +32 +32 -1 -2 -2=65 -5=60=2²*3*5. That\\'s four prime factors, but with repetition, so not three distinct primes.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=3:1 +32 +243 -1 -2 -3=276 -6=270. 270=2*3³*5. Again multiple factors. Not three distinct.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=2:32*3 -6=96-6=90=2*3²*5. Not three distinct.\\n\\nHow about x=1, y=2, z=4:1 +32 +1024 -1 -2 -4=1057 -7=1050. 1050=2*3*5²*7. That\\'s four distinct primes with repetition. Not three.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=4:32 +243 +1024 -2 -3 -4=1299 -9=1290. 1290=2*3*5*43. Four distinct primes. So that\\'s four, not three.\\n\\nHmm. Let\\'s try x=1, y=1, z=3:1 +1 +243 -1 -1 -3=244 -5=239. 239 is a prime. So that\\'s a single prime, not a product of three.\\n\\nx=1, y=3, z=3:1 +243 +243 -1 -3 -3=487 -7=480. 480=2^5*3*5. Three distinct primes but with exponents higher than 1. But the problem says \"a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers\", so exponents don\\'t matter as long as each prime is present once. Wait, no. Wait, if it\\'s a product of exactly three distinct primes, then it should be equal to p1*p2*p3 where p1, p2, p3 are distinct primes. So exponents all must be 1. So 480 is not acceptable because it\\'s 2^5*3*5. So even though it has three distinct primes, the exponents are higher. Therefore, 480 is out.\\n\\nSo maybe p=5 is not possible. Let me try x=2, y=3, z=5. 32 +243 +3125 -2 -3 -5=3400 -10=3390. 3390 factors into 2*3*5*113. So four distinct primes. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=1, y=1, z=5:1 +1 +3125 -1 -1 -5=3126 -7=3119. 3119 is a prime? Let me check. 3119 divided by 2: no. 3: 3+1+1+9=14, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 9, no. 7: 7*445=3115, 3119-3115=4. Not divisible. 11: 11*283=3113, 3119-3113=6. Not. 13: 13*239=3107, 3119-3107=12. Not divisible. 17: 17*183=3111, 3119-3111=8. Not. 19: 19*164=3116, 3119-3116=3. Not. 23: 23*135=3105, 3119-3105=14. Not divisible. So 3119 might be a prime. Therefore, that\\'s a single prime, which isn\\'t the product of three.\\n\\nAlternatively, try x=1, y=3, z=2:1 +243 +32 -1 -3 -2=276 -6=270. As before, 2*3^3*5. Not three distinct.\\n\\nWait, maybe x=2, y=2, z=3:32 +32 +243 -2 -2 -3=307 -7=300. 300=2²*3*5². Again multiple exponents. So even though three distinct primes, the exponents are higher than one, so not a product of exactly three distinct primes. The problem specifies \"a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers\", which I think means that the total is a semiprime with three distinct primes, each to the first power. So exponents must be 1.\\n\\nSo for p=5, seems challenging to get such a product. Maybe possible with larger numbers? Let me try x=2, y=2, z=5:32 +32 +3125 -2 -2 -5=3189 -9=3180. 3180=2²*3*5*53. Four distinct primes. Not good.\\n\\nx=3, y=3, z=3:243*3 -9=729 -9=720=2^4*3²*5. Nope.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=3:32 +243 +243 -2 -3 -3=518 -8=510=2*3*5*17. Four distinct primes.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe it\\'s not possible for p=5. Let me check another way. Let\\'s suppose that x, y, z are small. For example, x=1, y=2, z=5. Then 1 +32 +3125 -1 -2 -5=3126 -8=3118. 3118=2*1559. 1559 is a prime. So 2*1559, which is two primes. Not three.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=1, y=4, z=5:1 +1024 +3125 -1 -4 -5=4150 -10=4140. 4140=2²*3²*5*23. Four distinct primes. Hmm.\\n\\nMaybe trying x=2, y=4, z=5:32 +1024 +3125 -2 -4 -5=4181 -11=4170. 4170=2*3*5*139. Four distinct primes.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=3, y=4, z=5:243 + 1024 + 3125 -3 -4 -5=4392 -12=4380. 4380=2²*3*5*73. Again four distinct primes.\\n\\nThis seems tough. Maybe p=5 is not possible. Let me check if there\\'s any possible combination. Alternatively, perhaps x, y, z are larger. For example, x=2, y=1, z=1:32 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=34 -4=30. Wait, 30 is 2*3*5. So x=2, y=1, z=1, p=5. Let\\'s compute x⁵ + y⁵ + z⁵ -x -y -z. 32 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=32+1+1=34; 34-4=30. Yes! 30 is 2*3*5. So that\\'s three distinct primes. Therefore, p=5 works.\\n\\nWait, really? Let me check again. x=2, y=1, z=1. Then 2⁵ +1⁵ +1⁵ -2 -1 -1=32 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=34 -4=30. Yes! 30 is indeed 2*3*5. So p=5 works as well. So, that\\'s surprising. So for p=5, x=2, y=1, z=1 gives 30. So p=5 is possible.\\n\\nHmm. So then p=5 is possible. Then maybe p=7? Let\\'s check. The expression is x⁷ + y⁷ + z⁷ -x -y -z. Let\\'s try small x, y, z.\\n\\nTake x=1, y=1, z=1:1 +1 +1 -1 -1 -1=0. Not good. x=2, y=1, z=1:128 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=130 -4=126. 126=2*3²*7. Not three distinct primes.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=1:128 +128 +1 -2 -2 -1=257 -5=252. 252=2²*3²*7. Not three distinct.\\n\\nx=2, y=1, z=2: same as above. 128 +1 +128 -2 -1 -2=257 -5=252.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=3:1 +128 +2187 -1 -2 -3=2316 -6=2310. 2310=2*3*5*7*11. That\\'s five distinct primes. Not three.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=2:1 +1 +128 -1 -1 -2=128 -3=125=5³. Not three.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=3:1 +1 +2187 -1 -1 -3=2187 -4=2183. Let\\'s check if 2183 is a prime. Divided by 3: 2+1+8+3=14, not divisible. Divided by 7: 7*311=2177, 2183-2177=6. Not. 11: 11*198=2178, 2183-2178=5. Not. 13: 13*167=2171, 2183-2171=12, divisible by 13? 12 isn\\'t. 17: 17*128=2176, 2183-2176=7. Not. 19: 19*114=2166, 2183-2166=17. Not. 23: 23*94=2162, 2183-2162=21. Not. 29: 29*75=2175, 2183-2175=8. Not. 31: 31*70=2170, 2183-2170=13. Not. So 2183 might be prime. If so, then it\\'s a single prime, not three.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=2, y=3, z=4:128 + 2187 + 16384 -2 -3 -4=187, 128+2187=2315; 2315+16384=187, 2315+16384=187, wait, 128+2187=2315, 2315+16384=187, that can\\'t be. Wait, 128+2187=2315, 2315+16384=187, that\\'s incorrect. Wait, 128+2187=2315, then 2315+16384=2315+16384=187, no. 2315+16384=187, that\\'s not possible. Wait, 16384 + 2315=187, no, 16384 + 2000=18384, no. Wait, 16384 + 2315. Let\\'s compute 16384 + 2000=18384, then +315=187, 18384+315=187, no, that\\'s 187, but 16384 + 2315=187, which is impossible. Wait, my mistake. 16384 + 2315=16384 + 2000=18384, 18384 + 315=187, 18384 +315=187, no. 18384 +315=187, 18384+315=187, that\\'s incorrect. Wait, 16384 + 2315 is 16384 + 2000=18384, then 18384 + 315=187, no. Wait, 16384 + 2315. Let\\'s compute 16384 + 2000=18384, then add 315: 18384 + 315=187, no. Wait, 16384 +2315: 16000 +2300=18300, 384 +15=399, so total 18300 +399=18699. Then subtract 2+3+4=9. So total 18699 -9=18690. 18690=1869*10=10*1869. 1869 divided by 3: 1+8+6+9=24, divisible by 3. 1869/3=623. 623: 6+2+3=11, not divisible by 3. Divided by 7: 7*89=623. 89 is prime. So 18690=2*3*5*7*89. Five distinct primes. Not three.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=2, y=1, z=1:128 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=130 -4=126=2*3²*7. Not three distinct primes.\\n\\nWait, but maybe x=3, y=1, z=1:3⁷=2187. So 2187 +1 +1 -3 -1 -1=2189 -5=2184. 2184=2³*3*7*13. Four distinct primes.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe x=1, y=2, z=2:1 +128 +128 -1 -2 -2=257 -5=252=2²*3²*7. Not three.\\n\\nWait, what about x=1, y=1, z=4:1 +1 +16384 -1 -1 -4=16385 -6=16379. Check if 16379 is a prime. Divided by 2: no. 3:1+6+3+7+9=26, not divisible. 5: ends with 9. 7: 7*2340=16380, 16379-16380=-1. Not divisible. 11: 11*1489=16379? 11*1400=15400, 11*89=979, total 15400+979=16379. So 11*1489=16379. Is 1489 a prime? Let\\'s check. 1489 divided by 13: 13*114=1482, 1489-1482=7. Not. 17: 17*87=1479, 1489-1479=10. Not. 19: 19*78=1482, 1489-1482=7. Not. 23: 23*64=1472, 1489-1472=17. Not. So 1489 is prime. Therefore, 16379=11*1489, two primes. Not three.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=1, y=3, z=1:1 +2187 +1 -1 -3 -1=2189 -5=2184 as before.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=2, y=2, z=2:3*128 -6=384 -6=378=2*3³*7. Not three distinct.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe p=7 is not possible. Let\\'s try another approach. Let\\'s see if we can get 30 again, but with p=7. 30=2*3*5. So can x⁷ + y⁷ + z⁷ -x -y -z=30? Let\\'s see. Since x, y, z are positive integers. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nIf x=2, y=1, z=1:128 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=126. 126 is larger than 30. x=1, y=1, z=2: same. 126.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=1:0. Not. x=1, y=1, z=3:2187 +1 +1 -1 -1 -3=2185. Way larger.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=1:1 +128 +1 -1 -2 -1=126. So 126. So even the minimal values give 126. So can\\'t get 30. So seems like p=7 cannot produce 30. So maybe p=7 is not possible.\\n\\nAlternatively, let\\'s see if we can get another number that\\'s a product of three distinct primes. Let\\'s try for p=7, x=2, y=3, z=1:128 +2187 +1 -2 -3 -1=2316 -6=2310=2*3*5*7*11. Five primes. Not good. x=2, y=3, z=4: as before, 18690=2*3*5*7*89. Five primes.\\n\\nx=3, y=3, z=3:3*2187 -9=6561 -9=6552. 6552 factors into... let\\'s see: 6552 divided by 8=819. 819=3*273=3*3*91=3*3*7*13. So 6552=8*3*3*7*13=2³*3²*7*13. Four distinct primes.\\n\\nx=2, y=4, z=5:128 + 16384 + 78125 -2 -4 -5=128+16384=16512; 16512+78125=94637; 94637 -11=94626. That\\'s a big number. Let\\'s factorize: 94626 divided by 2=47313. 47313 divided by 3=15771. Divided by 3=5257. Check if 5257 is prime. 5+2+5+7=19, not divisible by 3. Divided by 5: ends with 7. 7: 7*751=5257. 7*700=4900, 7*51=357, total 4900+357=5257. So 5257=7*751. 751 is prime. So 94626=2*3²*7*751. Four distinct primes. Not good.\\n\\nHmm. So for p=7, seems challenging. Let me check x=1, y=2, z=5. 1 +128 + 78125 -1 -2 -5=78254 -8=78246. 78246 divided by 2=39123. Divided by 3=13041. Divided by 3=4347. Divided by 3=1449. Divided by 3=483. Divided by 3=161. Which is 7*23. So 78246=2*3^5*7*23. Multiple primes. Not three.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=1, y=3, z=2:1 +2187 +128 -1 -3 -2=2316 -6=2310 as before.\\n\\nSo seems like for p=7, any small x, y, z lead to either too many prime factors or primes with exponents. Maybe p=7 is impossible. Let me check if there\\'s a larger x, y, z combination that could result in three distinct primes. But this is getting cumbersome. Let\\'s think differently.\\n\\nNote that for p=2,3,5, we found solutions. For p=7, it\\'s unclear. Let\\'s check if there\\'s a mathematical reason why higher primes might not work. For example, perhaps for primes p >=7, x^p grows too quickly, so the expression x^p + y^p + z^p -x - y - z is too large to be a product of three small primes. But even so, the product of three primes can be large if the primes are large. However, the problem requires the product to be exactly three distinct primes, not necessarily small. However, as p increases, x^p becomes massive even for small x, making it difficult to control the total to be a product of exactly three primes.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe only small primes work. Let\\'s check p=7 with x=1, y=1, z= some larger number. Let\\'s say z=2. Then x=1, y=1, z=2:1 +1 +128 -1 -1 -2=126. As before. 126=2*3²*7. Not three distinct.\\n\\nz=3:1 +1 +2187 -1 -1 -3=2183. Which we thought might be prime. If it\\'s prime, then single prime. If composite, maybe product of two primes. If it\\'s product of two primes, then that\\'s not three. If product of three primes, but that\\'s unlikely. 2183: we tried dividing by primes up to 31 and it wasn\\'t divisible, so perhaps it\\'s a prime. So 2183 is a prime. Thus, no.\\n\\nSimilarly, x=1, y=1, z=4:16384 -4=16380. 16380=2²*3²*5*7*13. Five distinct primes.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=5:1 +1 + 161051 -1 -1 -5=161051 -6=161045. 161045 divided by 5=32209. Check if 32209 is prime. 32209 divided by 7: 7*4601=32207, remainder 2. 11: 11*2928=32208, remainder 1. 13: 13*2477=32201, remainder 8. 17: 17*1894=322, 17*1894=322, 17*100=1700, 17*894=15198, total 1700+15198=16898. Not. Maybe 32209 is prime. So 161045=5*32209. Two primes. Not three.\\n\\nTherefore, even with larger z, it\\'s hard to get three primes. So perhaps p=7 is not possible. Let\\'s check p=7, x=2, y=1, z=1:128 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=126. As before, not good.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=3, y=1, z=1:2187 +1 +1 -3 -1 -1=2185. Check if 2185 is a product of three primes. 2185 divided by 5=437. 437: divided by 19=23. 19*23=437. So 2185=5*19*23. Three distinct primes! Wait, hold on. 2185=5*19*23. So that is a product of exactly three distinct primes. So, if x=3, y=1, z=1 with p=7, the expression is 3⁷ +1⁷ +1⁷ -3 -1 -1=2187 +1 +1 -5=2184. Wait, no, 2187 +1 +1=2189. 2189 -3 -1 -1=2189 -5=2184. Wait, but 2184=2189-5=2184. Wait, earlier I thought x=3, y=1, z=1 gives 2184. But 2184 factors into 2³*3*7*13. Four distinct primes. But wait, earlier, when I thought x=3, y=1, z=1:3⁷=2187, then 2187 +1 +1=2189. Then subtract 3+1+1=5. So 2189 -5=2184. So 2184=2³*3*7*13. Four distinct primes. So my mistake earlier, 2185 is different. Wait, how did I get 2185? Maybe a miscalculation. Let me recalculate:\\n\\nIf x=3, y=1, z=1 for p=7:3⁷ +1⁷ +1⁷ -3 -1 -1=2187 +1 +1 -3 -1 -1=2189 -5=2184. So 2184, not 2185. So my previous thought about 2185 was incorrect. Therefore, even x=3, y=1, z=1 gives 2184=2³*3*7*13. Still four distinct primes.\\n\\nSo maybe p=7 doesn\\'t work. Then, what about p=11? Wait, the problem says \"Find all prime numbers p\". So maybe p=2,3,5 work. Let\\'s check p=7 again. Wait, maybe there\\'s another combination. Let\\'s try x=4, y=1, z=1:4⁷=16384. So 16384 +1 +1 -4 -1 -1=16386 -6=16380=2²*3²*5*7*13. Five distinct primes. Not good.\\n\\nWait, perhaps x=5, y=1, z=1:5⁷=78125. 78125 +1 +1 -5 -1 -1=78127 -7=78120. 78120=2³*3*5*7*11*17. Six distinct primes. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=2, y=3, z=5:128 +2187 + 161051 -2 -3 -5=163366 -10=163356. Factorizing that would be tedious, but likely multiple primes.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=3, y=3, z=1:2187*2 +1 -3*2 -1=4374 +1 -6 -1=4368. 4368=16*273=16*3*91=16*3*7*13=2^4*3*7*13. Four distinct primes.\\n\\nHmm. It seems that for p=7, no combination of x, y, z gives a product of exactly three distinct primes. Therefore, perhaps p=2,3,5 are possible, and primes larger than 5 are not.\\n\\nWait, but p=5 worked with x=2, y=1, z=1. Let\\'s check p=7, x=2, y=1, z=1:128 +1 +1 -2 -1 -1=126=2*3²*7. Not three distinct primes.\\n\\nWait, is there another approach? Let\\'s note that for p=2,3,5, we can get 30, which is 2*3*5. For p=2, x=4, y=4, z=3; p=3, x=1, y=2, z=3; p=5, x=2, y=1, z=1. So in each case, we can set the expression to 30. For higher primes, like p=7, is 30 achievable? Let\\'s check. For p=7, x^7 + y^7 + z^7 -x -y -z=30. Let\\'s see if there are x, y, z such that this holds.\\n\\nBut x, y, z are positive integers. The smallest x^7 for x=2 is 128, which is already larger than 30. So the only possible x, y, z are 1. But x=y=z=1 gives 0. If two variables are 1 and one is 2: 1 +1 +128 -1 -1 -2=126. Not 30. So p=7 cannot reach 30. So 30 is too small for p=7. For higher primes, even more so.\\n\\nTherefore, maybe the only primes are 2,3,5. Let me check p=7 again. Suppose we look for another product of three distinct primes, not necessarily 30. Let\\'s say the product is 105=3*5*7. Let\\'s see if x^7 + y^7 + z^7 -x -y -z=105.\\n\\nLet\\'s try x=2, y=2, z=2:3*128 -6=378. Too big. x=2, y=2, z=1:128 +128 +1 -2 -2 -1=257 -5=252. 252=2²*3²*7. Not 105.\\n\\nx=1, y=2, z=3:1 +128 +2187 -1 -2 -3=2316 -6=2310. 2310=2*3*5*7*11. Five primes. Not 105.\\n\\nx=1, y=1, z=3:1 +1 +2187 -1 -1 -3=2184. As before.\\n\\nx=2, y=1, z=3:128 +1 +2187 -2 -1 -3=2316 -6=2310. Again five primes.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=1, y=3, z=1: same as x=1, y=1, z=3. 2184. Not 105.\\n\\nWait, maybe x=1, y=2, z=2:1 +128 +128 -1 -2 -2=257 -5=252. Not 105.\\n\\nx=1, y=4, z=1:1 +16384 +1 -1 -4 -1=16385 -6=16379=11*1489. Two primes.\\n\\nHmm. Alternatively, target a larger product of three primes. Let\\'s say 385=5*7*11. Can we get 385?\\n\\nTry x=3, y=1, z=1:2187 +1 +1 -3 -1 -1=2184. Not 385.\\n\\nx=2, y=3, z=1:128 +2187 +1 -2 -3 -1=2316 -6=2310. 2310=2*3*5*7*11. That\\'s five primes. Close, but not 385.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=2, y=4, z=1:128 +16384 +1 -2 -4 -1=16513 -7=16506. 16506=2*3*3*7*131. Five primes.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=3, y=2, z=1:2187 +128 +1 -3 -2 -1=2316 -6=2310 again.\\n\\nAlternatively, x=1, y=3, z=2:1 +2187 +128 -1 -3 -2=2316 -6=2310.\\n\\nHmm. It seems that for p=7, it\\'s difficult to get a product of three distinct primes. All attempts either result in too many primes or exponents higher than one. Therefore, perhaps p=7 and higher primes do not work. Thus, the primes are p=2,3,5.\\n\\nBut let\\'s check p=5 again. We had x=2, y=1, z=1 giving 30. Any other examples for p=5? For example, x=3, y=1, z=1:243 +1 +1 -3 -1 -1=244 -5=239. Prime. Not three. x=3, y=2, z=1:243 +32 +1 -3 -2 -1=276 -6=270=2*3³*5. Not three distinct.\\n\\nx=2, y=2, z=1:32 +32 +1 -2 -2 -1=65 -5=60=2²*3*5. Three distinct primes but with exponents. So not acceptable.\\n\\nWait, the problem says \"a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers\". So even if exponents are higher, but the primes are three distinct, does it count? For example, 60=2²*3*5. It has three distinct primes but with exponents. The problem says \"a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers\". The wording is ambiguous. If \"product\" is in the sense of multiplying three distinct primes each appearing once, then exponents must be 1. If it just requires that the total number of distinct prime factors is three, regardless of exponents, then 60 would qualify. But the problem says \"a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers\", which probably means that the expression factors as p1*p2*p3, where p1, p2, p3 are distinct primes. Therefore, exponents must be 1. Hence, for example, 60 wouldn\\'t qualify, but 30=2*3*5 would. So for p=5, x=2, y=1, z=1 gives 30, which works. For p=5, x=3, y=2, z=1 gives 270=2*3³*5, which is not three distinct primes multiplied once. So only x=2, y=1, z=1 works for p=5.\\n\\nSimilarly, for p=2 and p=3, we have examples that give 30. Are there other examples for p=2 and p=3 that result in other products of three distinct primes?\\n\\nFor p=2, x=4, y=4, z=3 gives 30. Let me check x=5, y=5, z=6:25 +25 +36 -5 -5 -6=86 -16=70=2*5*7. Three distinct primes. So yes, another example. So 70 is 2*5*7. So p=2 allows other products as well. Similarly, x=5, y=5, z=6 gives x² + y² + z² -x -y -z=70. So p=2 is possible.\\n\\nSimilarly, for p=3, x=1, y=2, z=3 gives 30. Are there other possibilities? For example, x=2, y=3, z=4:8 +27 +64 -2 -3 -4=99 -9=90=2*3²*5. Not three distinct. x=1, y=3, z=4:1 +27 +64 -1 -3 -4=92 -8=84=2²*3*7. Not three distinct. x=1, y=1, z=4:1 +1 +64 -1 -1 -4=66 -6=60=2²*3*5. Not three distinct. x=2, y=2, z=3:8 +8 +27 -2 -2 -3=43 -7=36=2²*3². Not three. x=1, y=2, z=4:1 +8 +64 -1 -2 -4=73 -7=66=2*3*11. Three distinct primes. So 66=2*3*11. Therefore, for p=3, x=1, y=2, z=4 gives 66, which is a product of three distinct primes. So p=3 works here as well.\\n\\nSo p=2,3,5 can generate such products, while p=7 and higher primes likely cannot. Therefore, the answer should be p=2,3,5.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe prime numbers are \\\\boxed{2}, \\\\boxed{3}, and \\\\boxed{5}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo find all prime numbers \\\\( p \\\\) for which there exist positive integers \\\\( x, y, \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) such that the expression \\\\( x^p + y^p + z^p - x - y - z \\\\) is a product of exactly three distinct prime numbers, we analyze the problem for small prime values and check if such combinations exist.\\n\\n1. **For \\\\( p = 2 \\\\)**:\\n   - The expression becomes \\\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x - y - z \\\\).\\n   - Trying \\\\( x = 4 \\\\), \\\\( y = 4 \\\\), \\\\( z = 3 \\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     4^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 - 4 - 4 - 3 = 16 + 16 + 9 - 4 - 4 - 3 = 30\\n     \\\\]\\n     - 30 factors into \\\\( 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\), which are three distinct primes.\\n   - Other examples, such as \\\\( x = 5 \\\\), \\\\( y = 5 \\\\), \\\\( z = 6 \\\\), yield 70, which factors into \\\\( 2 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\).\\n\\n2. **For \\\\( p = 3 \\\\)**:\\n   - The expression becomes \\\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - x - y - z \\\\).\\n   - Trying \\\\( x = 1 \\\\), \\\\( y = 2 \\\\), \\\\( z = 3 \\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 - 1 - 2 - 3 = 1 + 8 + 27 - 1 - 2 - 3 = 30\\n     \\\\]\\n     - 30 factors into \\\\( 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\), which are three distinct primes.\\n   - Another example, \\\\( x = 1 \\\\), \\\\( y = 2 \\\\), \\\\( z = 4 \\\\), yields 66, which factors into \\\\( 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 11 \\\\).\\n\\n3. **For \\\\( p = 5 \\\\)**:\\n   - The expression becomes \\\\( x^5 + y^5 + z^5 - x - y - z \\\\).\\n   - Trying \\\\( x = 2 \\\\), \\\\( y = 1 \\\\), \\\\( z = 1 \\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     2^5 + 1^5 + 1^5 - 2 - 1 - 1 = 32 + 1 + 1 - 2 - 1 - 1 = 30\\n     \\\\]\\n     - 30 factors into \\\\( 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\), which are three distinct primes.\\n\\n4. **For primes \\\\( p \\\\geq 7 \\\\)**:\\n   - Testing small values and combinations shows that the expression grows too quickly to be a product of exactly three distinct primes.
